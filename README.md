### 🛒 Analyzing 100,000 Orders to Uncover Key Insights

This project involves an in-depth analysis of an e-commerce dataset with 100,000 orders across multiple categories. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights that can help businesses improve customer engagement, optimize sales strategies, and streamline operations.

- **Payment Preferences**: **78.44%** of customers preferred credit card payments over other methods.
- **Sales Opportunities**: Identified potential to increase **Q4 sales** by targeting promotions and optimizing delivery services.

## 📑 Dataset

- **Payment Type**: Methods such as credit card, PayPal, etc.
- **Geolocation**: States where the orders were placed.

The dataset was cleaned to remove missing values and normalized to ensure consistency.

## 📊 Analysis Process

The analysis was divided into several steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured consistency by removing null values, duplicates, and irrelevant fields using Excel and Power Query.
2. **Data Modeling**: Joined multiple tables in **Powerbi** to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
3. **Visualizations in Power BI**: Created interactive dashboards to visualize key insights.
